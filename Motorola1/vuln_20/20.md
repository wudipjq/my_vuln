## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in Motorola router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `prog.cgi` binary:

In `SetStationSettings` function, `station_mac` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `station_mac` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, in `sub_402D74` function, the initial input has not checked and cause command injection.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></div>

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `station_mac` as **`telnetd${IFS}-l${IFS}sh`** , and the router will excute it,such as:
