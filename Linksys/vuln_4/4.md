## Vulnerability description

We found an command Injection vulnerability in Linksys router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `mod_form.so` binary:

In `setDeviceURL` function, `DeviceURL` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `DeviceURL` to attack the OS.

**Supplement**

in the program. In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `DeviceURL` as **`busybox telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 2226`** , and the router will excute it,such as:

```http
