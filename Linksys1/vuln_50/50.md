## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in Linksys router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `mod_form.so` binary:

In the router's `setOpMode` function, `ethConv` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow, so we can control the `ethConv` to execute arbitrary code.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked. And then,call the function `nvram_bufset ` to store this input.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

Eventually, in `setWan` function, the initial input will be directly copy to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing buffer overflow.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></div>

Vulnerability trigger steps:

* set `ethConv`=**aaaaa......**, in (`setOpMode`)
* Trigger the vulnerability, in (`setWan`)

**Supplement**

in the program. In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

set `ethConv`=**aaaaa......**, in (`setOpMode`)
