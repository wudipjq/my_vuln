## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in TOTOLink router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `ap.so` binary:

In `QuickSetting` function, `hour、minute` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `hour、minute` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, the initial input will be extracted and cause command injection.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `hour` as **`telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1114`** , and the router will excute it,such as:
