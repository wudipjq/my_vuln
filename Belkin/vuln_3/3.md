Vendor:Belkin

Product:F9K1122

Version:1.00.33

Type:Remote Command Execution

## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in Belkin router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `webs` binary:

In `mp` function, `command` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `command` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, the initial input will be extracted and cause command injection.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `command` as **`ping 192.168.1.6`** , and the router will excute it,such as:

```http
