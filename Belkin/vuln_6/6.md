## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in Belkin router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.

**Stack Overflow**

In `webs` binary:

In the router's `formPPTPSetup` function, `pptpUserName` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow, so we can control the `pptpUserName` to execute arbitrary code.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked. The parameter `pptpUserName` is directly copy to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing buffer overflow.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `pptpUserName` as **aaaaa......** , and the router will crash, such as:
