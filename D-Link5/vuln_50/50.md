## Vulnerability description

We found an stack overflow vulnerability in D-Link router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to crash the server.（without authentication）

Gets the token ID.

```
curl http://192.168.1.1/dir_login.asp | grep tokenid
```

**Stack Overflow**

In `goahead` binary:

In the router's `wirelessApcli_5g` function, `apcli_mode_5g、apcli_enc_5g、apcli_default_key_5g` is directly passed by the attacker, If this part of the data is too long, it will cause the stack overflow, so we can control the `apcli_mode_5g、apcli_enc_5g、apcli_default_key_5g` to execute arbitrary code.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked. And then,call the function `nvram_bufset` to store this input.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/1.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></div>

the initial input is directly copy to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing buffer overflow.

<div  align="center"><img src="./images/2.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></div>

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `apcli_enc_5g` as **aaaaa......** , and the router will crash, such as:

## Result

The target router crashes and cannot provide services correctly and persistently.
