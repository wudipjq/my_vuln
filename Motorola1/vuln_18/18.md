Vendor:Motorola

Product:CX2L

Version:1.0.1

Type:Remote Command Execution

## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in Motorola router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `prog.cgi` binary:

In `SetWLanACLSettings` function, `wl(0).(0)_maclist_mode、wl(0).(0)_maclist` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `wl(0).(0)_maclist_mode、wl(0).(0)_maclist` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, the initial input will be extracted and cause command injection.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.



## PoC

We set `wl(0).(0)_maclist_mode` as **`telnetd -l sh`** , and the router will excute it,such as:
